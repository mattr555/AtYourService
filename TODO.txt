What should happen before a 0.9 (closed beta) release:
	Django admin page
	No JOINS
	Caching

What should happen before a 1.0 release:
	Test suite
	Sexier, not as bootstrappy UI
	Better mobile UI

Other, low priority ideas (1.1/2.0):
	Integration with GCal/todo app
	PDF output

Done:
	0.1.0:
		User account manipulation
		Email notification
			cron + django.core.mail
